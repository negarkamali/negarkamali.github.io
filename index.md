I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at Northwestern University, advised by <a href="https://mattgroh.com/" target="_blank">Matt Groh</a> and <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/" target="_blank">Jessica Hullman</a>. My research focuses on how humans understand and interact with advanced AI systems -- from detecting AI-generated media to making better decisions with AI assistance. I am broadly interested in **AI alignment**, **mechanistic interpretability**, and building tools that help people reason effectively about AI outputs.

Before my current PhD, I completed a Ph.D. in Computational Mechanics, where I developed numerical methods for nonlinear wave propagation PDEs. I also have industry experience as a Software Developer and Automation Expert. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221006477" target="_blank">This paper</a> sparked my decision to return to academia and study human-AI collaboration.

## Research Interests

- **Human-AI Interaction & Decision-Making** -- How do people use (and misuse) AI advice?
- **AI-Generated Media Detection** -- Understanding what makes deepfakes convincing and how to help people spot them
- **AI Alignment & Mechanistic Interpretability** -- Making AI systems more transparent and aligned with human values
- **Uncertainty Quantification in ML** -- Conformal prediction and calibrated uncertainty for human-facing AI

## Miscellaneous

I enjoy long-distance running. I have run the Chicago Marathon four times and the Berlin 50th BMW Marathon once.
