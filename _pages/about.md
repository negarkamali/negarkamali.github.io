Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Northwestern University, advised by Professor [Jessica Hullman](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/). My interests lie in Human-AI team decision-making, uncertainty quantification and trustworthy decision support systems. More specifically, my research is on enhancing AI-advised decision-making by accurately quantifying the prediction uncertainty of deep Neural Networks (NNs). I explore the effectiveness of conformal prediction sets as an alternative to traditional uncertainty measures, and how they impact human decisions in various real-world scenarios.

Earlier, I completed a Ph.D. in Computational Mechanics, during which I developed several advanced numerical methods for solving nonlinear wave propagation PDEs. Following my passion in understanding how AI impacts human decision-making, I began a second Ph.D. in Computer Science at Northwestern University. 

I also have prior industry experience as a Software Developer and Automation Expert.  

## On-going Projects

I am currently working on a project with [MU Collective](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/) that emphasizes AI-advised text classification, and robust uncertainty quantification.

The second project I am currently working on is in collaboration with the [Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence (CASMI)](https://casmi.northwestern.edu/) advised by [Maia Jacobs](https://sites.northwestern.edu/nupath/people/) to [Co-Design Patient-Facing Machine Learning for Prenatal Stress Reduction](https://casmi.northwestern.edu/research/projects/prenatal-stress-reduction.html).
