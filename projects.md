## Current Projects

I am investigating how people detect AI-generated images and what factors make them miss the subtle artifacts these images contain, under supervision of <a href="https://mattgroh.com/" target="_blank">Matt Groh</a> at Kellogg School of Management. My research aims to develop tools and techniques to enhance human ability to distinguish between real and synthetic images. In a world where AI-generated images are increasingly realistic, understanding how people perceive them is crucial for combating misinformation and maintaining trust in visual media.

Think you can distinguish real photos from AI-generated images? Try our <a href="https://detectfakes.kellogg.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">DetectFakes</a> website!

## Past Projects

**Conformal Prediction for AI-Advised Decisions:** I researched enhancing AI-advised decision-making by accurately quantifying prediction uncertainty of deep neural networks. I explored the effectiveness of conformal prediction sets as an alternative to traditional uncertainty measures, measuring how they impact human decisions in real-world image labeling scenarios. This work received a **Best Paper Honorable Mention** at CHI 2024.

**Prenatal Stress Reduction:** In collaboration with the <a href="https://casmi.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence (CASMI)</a>, advised by <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/nupath/people/" target="_blank">Maia Jacobs</a>, I worked on <a href="https://casmi.northwestern.edu/research/projects/prenatal-stress-reduction.html" target="_blank">co-designing patient-facing machine learning for prenatal stress reduction</a>.
